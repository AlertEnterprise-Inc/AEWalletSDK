## Features

- **Pass Management**: Create, update, and manage Apple Wallet passes.
- **Pass Retrieval**: Retrieve and query existing passes in the Wallet.
- **Customizable Passes**: Support for custom pass designs and metadata.
- **Delegates and Callbacks**: Handle pass-related events and updates with delegate callbacks.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

To add `AlertWalletSDK` to your project using Swift Package Manager:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Select 'File' > 'Add Packagesâ€¦'' from the menu.
3. in the dialog that appears, enter the following URL in the search bar:
```ruby
https://github.com/AlertEnterprise-Inc/AlertWalletSDK.git
```
4. Choose the version you want to install and click `Add Package`.
   Alternatively, you can manually add it by including the following in your `Package.swift` file:
```ruby
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/AlertEnterprise-Inc/AlertWalletSDK.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
## Getting Started
1. Import the Library
Import the `AlertWalletSDK` module into your Swift files where you plan to use it:
```swift
import AlertWalletSDK
```
2. Configure the SDK
Ensure that the SDK is properly configured in your app. This may involve setting up necessary credentials or configurations specific to your use case.


## Usage

1. implement a class / controller that conforms to AlertWalletControllerDelegate
```swift
class AlertViewController : UIViewController,AlertWalletControllerDelegate
```
2. To handle these events, you need to set your class as the delegate of AlertWalletController
```swift
 AlertWalletController.shared.delegate = self
```
Explanation:
`viewDidLoad():` Called after the view controller has loaded its view hierarchy into memory. This is where UI setup is typically performed.
3. Call functions of AlertWalletController(Singleton) using shared reference
```swift
AlertWalletController.shared.isWatchPaired()
AlertWalletController.shared.getRemotePasses()
AlertWalletController.shared.getDevicePasses()
```
4. To handle these events, you need to implement delegate functions accordingly for Eg
The `startPassProvisioning` method in `AlertWalletController` is responsible for initiating the process of provisioning a pass to Apple Wallet. This process involves creating or updating a pass in the user's Wallet, which requires interaction with Apple Wallet's APIs.
```swift
 AlertWalletController.shared.startPassProvisioning(identityId: userId,identityMobileCredentialId:badgeId)
```
will delegate response to `provisioningSuccess` or `provisioningError`

```swift
func provisioningError(_ controller: AlertWalletController, credentialCreateError credential: ProvisionAPIErrorResponse) {
        Self.logger.debug("implement Error flow" )
    }
```
```swift
func provisioningSuccess(_ controller: AlertWalletController, credentialCreateSuccess credential: ProvisioningCredential) {
        Self.logger.debug(" \(credential.provisioningInformation.provisioningCredentialIdentifier)" )
        Self.logger.debug(" \(credential.provisioningInformation.cardTemplateIdentifier)" )
        Self.logger.debug(" \(credential.provisioningInformation.sharingInstanceIdentifier)" )
        AlertWalletController.shared.saveToWallet(parentViewController: self, credential: credential)
    }
```
